# JCC

JCC, the Johan Compiler Collection, is a collection of toy compilers built using 
[ANTLR4](http://www.antlr.org) and [flat assembler](http://flatassembler.net). 
The current version of JCC is far from being complete. It supports the 
[Tiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_programming_language) programming language, 
as well as a very small subset of [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

Please note that while JCC itself is licensed under GPLv3, the included version of 
the [flat assembler](http://flatassembler.net) is licensed under a specific license.
The text of this license can be found in the fasm sub directory of the project.
